      <h3 class="section-title">How I Stumbled Into Programming</h3>
      <p>My first encounter with programming was accidental. In 7th grade, I overheard classmates discussing a C++ course. 
        It sounded like something smart people did, and I was intrigued.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>"I remember being equal parts intimidated and 
          fascinated when I saw those curly braces and semicolons for the first time. It looked like a secret language, and part of me wanted to understand it."</p>
      </div>

<h3 class="section-title">The Cyber Security Fascination</h3>
<p>My fascination with cyber security started when I watched movies featuring ethical hackers — people who used their skills to outsmart systems and protect others. 
  It wasn't just about breaking in; it was about understanding how things worked at a deep level. 
  I started reading about real-world hacks, exploring how digital vulnerabilities were exploited, and how security experts countered them. The more I learned,
   the more I wanted to be one of them. I also love other it fiedls like software more on  game developmet,machine learning,and data science. 
   I am willing to exlploer more about them in the future.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p>“Cyber security isn't just coding. It's like playing detective in a digital world — you find clues, identify weaknesses, and build stronger systems.”</p>
</div>

      <h3 class="section-title">Where I Am Now</h3>
<p>Today, as a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Gondar, I've built projects, debugged errors, and collaborated with classmates on assignments that once felt impossible. 
  I'm still learning every day — whether it's Java, C++, or HTML/CSS — but I now see every challenge as an opportunity to grow.</p>

<p>My focus is expanding beyond just writing code. I'm diving deeper into cyber security fundamentals, from learning how to spot vulnerabilities to practicing secure coding techniques. 
  I also enjoy understanding how front-end design can enhance user trust — which is critical in building secure systems.</p>

<div class="real-talk">
  <h4>Real Talk</h4>
  <p>I'm not a genius. I'm a learner. I keep going even when things don't work the first time. And that, I’ve found, is more powerful than talent.</p>
